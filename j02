I am currently working on a Computer Animation and Game Development major in the Animation Track with a CGI focus. In less confusing terms, this means I am learning how to make the visuals for a videogame or film. Much like a potter must sculpt a bowl and then paint on its color, I must create a blank 3D model and then add on color and details. For the task of adding color and details, I use a program called Adobe Substance 3D Painter. Think of it like Photoshop on a 3D canvas.

A render essentially means setting up the model with lighting and filters to make a high-quality photograph of my model in some sort of scene. One way to do this is to use a feature in the Substance Painter program called IRAY. Clicking the IRAY button opens a separate program window that allows me to adjust lighting and add filters that can help fake depth. I can also adjust the background as well as some photograph effects like the image’s overall contrast or saturation. It is a **useful** product that **serves the purpose** of allowing me to create a quick render without having to load my model and the texture into a separate program.

Unfortunately, the first time I used this feature revealed it to not be very **efficient** or **error tolerant**. My first assignment required me to create a texture for a provided “Spider Bot”.  The texturing portion of the assignment wen
