**"Maya Icon Problems”**

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the importance of icons. Properly used, icons are a way to use common iconography to imply to the user a button’s intended purpose. This can save a lot of space on the screen, as you can avoid having to use a lot of typed-out labels. For instance, think of the power button on your computer. It is likely labeled with a circle with a line splitting through the top. Think about how much more space that button would take up if we had to write out the word “Power” on or next to the button. A **useful** icon quickly allows the user to infer meaning and find what they are looking for. It serves a purpose to the user.
However, the usefulness of icons can occasionally lead some app developers to go overboard. Like most things, icons are only good in moderation.  When you have too many of them it can overwhelm the user and make it more difficult to find what they are looking for. The usefulness of an icon depends on how **memorable** the icon and its meaning is. 
Now that we’ve established what determines the usefulness of an icon, I would like to talk about a particular program and incident that I believe demonstrates the importance of proper icon usage. The example I would like to cover today is Maya. Maya is program by Autodesk and is the leading program used to create 3D models for animation. Maya has many windows and toolbars for different uses, to the point that it has preset “workspaces” with certain configurations of toolbars and windows the developers believe you will need for that purpose. Let’s take a look at the “Modeling-Standard” workspace.  
I went through and counted to find that there are about 135 icons in this workspace alone. That is 135 images that you are meant to understand the meaning of. I remember the first time I ever opened the Maya application I felt horrified. How in the world was I ever going to remember what all of these buttons do? The truth is after taking two classes utilizing this application, I have discovered that you don’t remember what half of them do. Even my professors teaching these classes have admitted that they do not know what some of these icons do. These are not memorable simple icons. This leads to many “hover searches” where I have to hover my mouse over each icon and wait for a description to pop up.  

 
I must then repeat this hovering until I find the button I am looking for. To exemplify the problem with this let’s consider a recent incident where I attempted to make a 3D model of a pumpkin, specifically when I tried to create its stem. To do this, I had to learn to use a new set of tools, the sculpt tools. 
To begin I needed to create a base to model on. Models in Maya are made up of “faces.” Let’s take a cube for example and remember a little of basic geometry. A cube is made up of 6 sides. Each of these sides is a smooth square surface, and in Maya, this is known as a “face”. Below I am using a face select tool to select the topmost face, highlighted in green.
 
Each face is made up of “vertices” which represent the four points of the square. To make something out of a cube we can move these vertices. Below you can see me using the vertices select tool to move one of the corners up for demonstration purposes. 


 
By this logic the “sculpt” tools let us push and pull vertices to sculpt like we would a piece of clay. To begin I made a basic stem shape and added plenty of faces that I could manipulate in my sculpting process. This went rather smoothly as the tools were familiar and had simple icons, such as the creation tool for a cube being shaped like a cube. You can see an example base shape below.  

 
Now, I recalled my teacher telling me to use the “sculpt tool” to sculpt. So, I went to the sculpting tab to look for it. 
 
And here we find the problem. Just looking at these icons, it is not clear what would be considered the “sculpt tool”. It is unclear what most of these icons mean. As I hovered over these icons, I discovered some rather strange icon definitions. Let’s take the icon below, for example. What do you suppose this icon means?

 
If I had to guess I would say it makes the surface have a bubbly texture to it. This mental image of how I assume something works is known in usability engineering as a mental map. Let’s see if I’m right.

 
“Softly lift a surface”. In other words, this tool lets us move vertices to slope down or up into gentle craters and hills. This is quite different from my mental map. Icons rely on mental mapping to work. The user should be able to infer the use of the icon from its image alone. If the user’s mental maps are not lining up with the actual function, then an icon is not useful. Most of the other icons in the sculpting bar have the same problem. It is entirely unclear what they are supposed to do, and makes the iconography feel arbitrary. Moreover, if the icon is unclear, even if someone learns what it does, it may not be memorable. 
As I went through all the sculpting tool icons I found, to my dismay, that there is no “sculpting tool” option. To get to this fabled tool I couldn’t even use icons in the sculpting section. I had to select one sculpting tool, mouse over the work area, press the right mouse key, and pick the “sculpting tool” from the resulting options wheel. 
 
This made me rather frustrated. Why even have a sculpting tab full of vague icons if you don’t even include the “sculpting tool”? Instead, of using the supposedly “quick and easy” shortcut system that the developers created, they appeared to have opted for an arbitrary system to get to the tool the tab was named for. This made the entire system of icons feel even less useful and memorable. 

The punchline in all of this is that while doing some research on Google, I discovered that in actuality the sculpt tool is included in the toolbar, but the developer’s icon system has gotten so out of hand that the names for their tools have been omitted. Instead of telling us the tool’s name, hovering over a tool tells us what it does. Hovering over the sculpt tool gets us the message below. 
 
If we right-click on the icon and open the settings for the tool

 
We see that it is labeled as the sculpt tool. We can also see the names of the other tools. For instance, “Softly lift surface” is known as the Foamy Tool. This means that not only is the mental mapping for what these icons mean inefficient but so is the mapping for searching through options for the tools that you need. 
 
This all brings us to the root issue with Maya and icons. Things are simply not visible. Everything is hidden behind a wall of vague icons and keystrokes. The purpose of icons is quite literally to make things visible. You should be able to see what it does so you know what you need to click to reach your goal. The user shouldn’t have to struggle to find out what a tool is called or what it does. 
In the end, I was able to model a pumpkin stem using the sculpting tools, but it wasn’t easy and I frequently had to hover search around for the type of tool I needed. Here’s a picture of the actual stem I made at the time. 

 
To fix the problem of Maya’s icons would be a rather large job. 135 icons alone are a lot of icons to review the usefulness of, but Maya has many more. The entire application is overpopulated with icons. I believe many tools could simply be made into settings for other tools, as well as tools that could use some less vague iconography. More than anything, though, I would recommend Maya make it easier for users to locate tools if a user is confused by the icons. If they are “hover searching” they should be able to find the names of tools, not just definitions. Take a program like Microsoft Word, for example. In Word, when you hover over icons you receive not only the name of the tool but also, its keystroke shortcut and its function. See the example below.
 
Something more like this would make learning Maya easier, would help instill memorability through consistent labeling, and could increase the overall usefulness of the icons.
